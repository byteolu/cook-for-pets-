Welcome to my dog blog, a place where ill show off my dog, dog food recipes, and pet parenting struggles , and the joy of pet parenting in your 20's. I remember the day I brought Fredo home, a tiny 8-week-old Doberman who hadnnt torn up, detroyed or peed on anything.... yet. I was determined to give him the best, starting with a mix of Fromm Puppy formula and raw meats. Those early days were filled with new experiences, as I figured my budget while making sure Fredo had the nourishment / balanced diet.

But, reality hit. Finances were tight, and regarless of my best efforts, I had to transition Fredo off the raw diet to kibble. This change, although necessary, was a tough decision. It was during this time I realized how much i loved feeding my pup – Fredo's balanced diet and my financial budget were a balancing act.

Fast forward to Fredo turning one, and things have started looking up. I was able to reintroduce him to fresh foods, but to my surprise (after $45 dollars food), he turned his nose up at raw chicken feet, gizzards, liver – the whole lot. It was a curveball I hadn’t expected. That’s when I turned my kitchen turned into a test lab, to began cooking meals for Fredo. It wasn't just about feeding him; it was about creating meals that nourished and catered to his big ass.

He ate so much :..( 

Now, two years down the line, Fredo is thriving when he is on a homemade diet, and I couldn't be prouder of how far we've come. This journey has taught me more than just the importance of a good diet for dogs and myseld. It's been about adapting to changes, managing responsibilities, and growing alongside Fredo. As a pet parent in my 20s, I’ve realized that we're both figuring out life – one meal at a time.

He just has wayyyy more time then me.

Through this blog, I will share not just the recipes that Fredo loves but videos on how to make them. It's about connecting with fellow pet parents, exchanging tales, tips, and perhaps a few laughs about the rollercoaster ride of raising a puppy in your 20s. So, whether you’re here for Fredo’s favorite recipes or just to find a pet parent in shared experiences, welcome! Let’s embark on this journey together, celebrating the highs, learning from the lows, and savoring every moment in between.
