Making the switch from kibble to homemade food a 100-pound Doberman was sort of a hassle, but a fun adventure. It's not just about tossing ingredients into a bowl; it's about meeting your dog's nutritional needs with a balanced diet through trial and error. 

The key is to transition gradually.Start by mixing 25% homemade food with 75% kibble, adjusting the ratio over several days while monitoring your dog's reaction. This gradual shift helps avoid digestive upset and allows you to observe how your dog responds to the new diet in terms of appetite, stool quality, weight, energy levels, and behavior.

F.Y.I - Interestingly, my Doberman isn't actually 100 lbs! While my initial goal was to have him above 98lbs, financial constraints and time limitations meant I couldn't fully commit to achieving this target. He currently weighs around 85-90lbs. This personal experience underscores the importance of flexibility and realism in managing our pets' diets and health.

Feeding the right amount is essential. The general guideline suggests feeding about 2-3% of the dogâ€™s body weight per day, split into two or more meals. This means for my 100-pound Doberman, I would start with around 2-3 pounds of homemade food daily. However, this can vary depending on factors like age, metabolism, and activity level.
