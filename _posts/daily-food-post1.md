I love food and often go out of my way to try new dishes that catch my eye. However, I haven't always been able to afford traveling by skateboarding, bus, or car, nor dining at restaurants or trying things I've seen online (like on YouTube or Instagram). So i starting cooking to fill that need. This led me to a delightful realization: Why not start cooking at home? So, my kitchen shenanigans began, mirroring my personal journey from a track athlete and CNA at UCLA to rediscovering my roots at mom’s after a rollercoaster ride through internships, Tech contracts, and a brave yet bumpy start-up venture.


My life took an unexpected turn with Fredo. Fredo wasn’t a planned addition – he was a great but random gift from a friend, bonded over shared passions for cars and dirt bikes, and a tribute to a mutual friend who passed. Owning Fredo meant embarking on late-night learning sprees, diving into the endless sea of pet care tips and tricks online. It was a new, exhilarating chapter of being a first-time pet parent.. 

Then came a twist in our tail. Family circumstances meant I couldn't stay at mom’s with Fredo(Very Large Family). Luckly , I moved in with the family who gave Fredo to me. This marked the beginning of a deeper journey into understanding and caring for my furry companion. When Fredo turned his nose up at his RAW diet, my culinary instincts kicked in – why not cook for him?


Cooking for Fredo became almost weekly if not daily ritual because:
- He LOVES homemade meals far more than any store-bought kibble.
- My passion for food and cooking (though , cleanup is a hassle).
- Can be an economical 

Now, let’s delve into the recipes and aamazing pup meals I whip up for Fredo.
